// What value does the following expression evaluate to? 

// '12' < '9'

// It would evaluate to true. This is because these are strings, not numbers. When using a comparison operator with strings, it will look at the first character and check it against the first character in the comparison. So it is comparing the string '1' with the string '9', and evaluates to the boolean true.
